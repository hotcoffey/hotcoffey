## 💡 About Me

I’m a results-driven technologist with expertise across enterprise, government, and consulting environments. My work focuses on solving complex problems through critical thinking, modernizing infrastructure, and mentoring teams to adopt cloud best practices. Key highlights:

- **Southwest Airlines (2022–2025)**: Built tools and pipelines that saved thousands of hours in cloud migrations, reduced cloud spend by 30%, and implemented company-wide observability with Datadog.
- **Onica (Rackspace) & Cloudreach (2019–2022)**: Led cloud migration projects, coached teams on AWS/GCP adoption, and delivered secure, high-performance architectures.
- **Core Skills**: AWS (EC2, S3, EKS, Lambda, CloudFormation), GCP (Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, BigQuery), Terraform, Terragrunt, Kubernetes, Docker, Python, Bash, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, Datadog, Grafana.
- **Certifications**: HashiCorp Terraform Associate (2024), former GCP Professional Cloud Architect, AWS Certified Solutions Architect, and more.

I’m passionate about the **open-source spirit** ❤️ and sharing knowledge ☁️, though my time is often split between work, raising my three young kids, and being a dedicated husband.
