## 💡 About Me

I’m a results-driven technologist with expertise across enterprise, government, and consulting environments. My work focuses on solving complex problems through critical thinking, modernizing infrastructure, and mentoring teams to adopt cloud best practices.

I’m passionate about the **open-source spirit** ❤️ and sharing knowledge ☁️, though my time is often split between work, raising my three young kids, and being a dedicated husband.
